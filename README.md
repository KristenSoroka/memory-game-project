# About

4/14: I was focusing too much on the responsive navigation and not the actual set up of the game and learning javascript.  Therefore, I removed the navigation entirely and I will create a new project that focuses soley on responsive navigations.  Eventually I can link the two, but for now I think this makes the most sense for learning purposed.

I thought of this project before realizing Ania had a project tutorial already done so I will be following thru on that!
